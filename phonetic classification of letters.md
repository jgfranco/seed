Classification of the alphabet based on the phonetic properties of each letter and its alignment with the maluma-takete effect.

## Vowels:
Vowels are often perceived as softer and more rounded, especially rounded vowels like "o" and "u". However, some vowels are more open or sharper, like "a" or "i".

Letter	Phonetic Property	Sound Symbolism (Maluma/Takete)	Assigned Shape/Value
A	Open front vowel	Broad, open (Maluma-like)	Circle, 1
E	Mid front vowel	Less open, slightly sharper	Oval, 2
I	Close front vowel	Sharp, focused (Takete-like)	Sharp angle, 7
O	Close-mid back rounded vowel	Round, soft (Maluma-like)	Full circle, 0
U	Close back rounded vowel	Round, soft (Maluma-like)	Oval, 1

## Consonants:
Consonants can be divided into soft, resonant sounds (like nasals or liquids) and sharp, abrupt sounds (like plosives or fricatives).

### Plosives (Sharp, Abrupt Sounds)
These consonants are more aligned with the takete side of the spectrum because of their hard, angular nature.

Letter	Phonetic Property	Sound Symbolism (Maluma/Takete)	Assigned Shape/Value
B	Voiced bilabial plosive	Somewhat soft, but plosive	Angular curve, 4
P	Voiceless bilabial plosive	Hard, abrupt (Takete-like)	Sharp angle, 6
D	Voiced dental/alveolar plosive	Hard, but voiced so less sharp	Square, 5
T	Voiceless dental/alveolar plosive	Hard, sharp (Takete-like)	Triangle, 7
K	Voiceless velar plosive	Sharp, very hard (Takete-like)	Triangle, 9
G	Voiced velar plosive	Less sharp, voiced version of "k"	Square, 5

### Fricatives (Continuous, Some Sharp, Some Soft)
Fricatives involve continuous airflow, and their sharpness depends on whether they are voiced or voiceless.

|Letter |	Phonetic Property |	Sound Symbolism (Maluma/Takete)	| Assigned Shape/Value
|---|---|---|---|
|F |	Voiceless labiodental fricative | Sharp, flowing (Takete-like) | Zigzag, 7
|V |	Voiced labiodental fricative |	Softer, less sharp	| Soft curve, 3
|S |	Voiceless alveolar fricative |	Sharp, hissing (Takete-like)	| Jagged line, 8
|Z |	Voiced alveolar fricative |	Softer, continuous sound |	S-shaped curve, 4
|H |	Voiceless glottal fricative |	Breath-like, soft	| Soft wave, 2
|TH | (voiceless)	Voiceless dental fricative |	Slightly sharp, continuous (Takete-like) | Zigzag, 6
|TH | (voiced)	Voiced dental fricative |	Softer, less sharp	| Gentle wave, 3

### Nasals (Soft, Rounded Sounds)
Nasals are typically resonant and soft, making them more aligned with maluma.

Letter	Phonetic Property	Sound Symbolism (Maluma/Takete)	Assigned Shape/Value
M	Bilabial nasal	Soft, round, resonant (Maluma-like)	Smooth curve, 2
N	Alveolar nasal	Soft, resonant (Maluma-like)	Gentle curve, 2
NG	Velar nasal	Soft, resonant	Wide curve, 2

### Liquids (Soft, Flowing Sounds)
Liquids have a flowing quality that tends to feel softer and more fluid, especially "l" and "r".

Letter	Phonetic Property	Sound Symbolism (Maluma/Takete)	Assigned Shape/Value
L	Lateral liquid	Soft, flowing (Maluma-like)	Gentle curve, 3
R	Rhotic liquid	Can be soft or rolled, flowing	Rolling curve, 3

### Glides (Very Soft, Maluma-like)
Glides like "w" and "y" are very soft and almost vowel-like, making them more aligned with maluma.

Letter	Phonetic Property	Sound Symbolism (Maluma/Takete)	Assigned Shape/Value
W	Voiced labio-velar approximant	Soft, round (Maluma-like)	Gentle wave, 1
Y	Voiced palatal approximant	Soft, flowing (Maluma-like)	Smooth arc, 2

### Affricates (Combination of Sharp and Soft Sounds)
Affricates start with a plosive (sharp) and end with a fricative (continuous), making them a combination of maluma and takete qualities.

Letter	Phonetic Property	Sound Symbolism (Maluma/Takete)	Assigned Shape/Value
CH	Voiceless post-alveolar affricate	Sharp, abrupt (Takete-like)	Angular spike, 8
J	Voiced post-alveolar affricate	Softer, but still has sharpness	Curved line, 6
